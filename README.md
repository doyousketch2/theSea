Love2D noise gen,  LÃ¶ve theSea  

You'll need Love2D to run this.  https://love2d.org  
If you don't have it, get it.

Used the Denver custom waveform generator to create it.  
https://github.com/superzazu/denver.lua  
No need to download, it's included.

I'd like figure out how to generate multiple voices with that lib,  
using threads, possibly.  

The procedural waves are chunky.  
Wanted to rotate points, but apparently that's not an option in Love2D.  

Might end up mipmap'n watery sprites, and let it splatter those all over the screen.  
It was fun for an hour of code.
