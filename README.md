# theSea
Love2D noise gen,  LÃ¶ve theSea  

Uses the Denver custom waveform generator.  
https://github.com/superzazu/denver.lua  

I'd like figure out how to do multiple voices with that lib,  
using threads, possibly.  

The procedural waves are chunky.  
Wanted to rotate points, but apparently that's not an option in Love2D.  

Might end up mipmap'n watery sprites, and let it splatter those all over the screen.  
It was fun for an hour of code.  

Uses Love2D.  https://love2d.org  
If you don't have it, get it.
